O*NET: Call for Inclusion of Behavior Analysis Occupations
At the time of writing, these links returned no direct results. We hope you click these links someday soon and find the following occupations:

A. Behavior Technician: https://www.onetonline.org/find/quick?s=Behavior+Technician

B. Behavior Analyst: https://www.onetonline.org/find/quick?s=Behavior+Analyst

What Is O*NET?
O*NET is a government sponsored online database containing descriptions of many thousands of occupations in the United States. O*NET is used by human resource management (HRM) professionals to define jobs in their organization for processes such as recruiting, training, and performance appraisal.

How Is O*NET Used?
HR managers use O*NET to define job elements, tasks, duties, description, and, ultimately, the job analysis. By looking at an occupation on O*NET, an HR manager can see the critical knowledge, skills, abilities, and competencies for an occupation that are common to many organizations. The amount of training required for a job, as well as the actual percentages of persons in the occupation and their education levels, can be found on O*NET.

What Is the Benefit of O*NET?
It is time consuming and expensive to define jobs thoroughly, so O*NET is a useful starting point by helping managers save time and get better results.

O*NET also provides details about the job, including survey data from persons working in the profession. This can include how frequently a person working in the field engages in a certain process (e.g., working directly with clients — 64 percent of respondents said “Almost every day.”).

How Does O*NET Relate to CRDS?
Today, CRDS conducted a search for behavior analysis jobs on O*NET. No results were found for “Behavior Technician” or “Behavior Analyst,” despite these occupations having formal certification(s) and inclusion in many state laws for autism therapy.

Why Is an O*NET Presence Important?
CRDS acknowledges that O*NET entries help to standardize how an occupation is described and included in organizations. Job descriptions based on information O*NET are likely to share more properties, which may lead to more consistency across Behavior Technician and Behavior Analyst roles in organizations.

What Harm May Come From Not Having an O*NET Presence?
CRDS is concerned that these professions may be missing out on opportunities to develop in a more structured way. Today, we acknowledge the need to enter Behavior Technician and Behavior Analyst roles into the O*NET database.

IN CASE YOU ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON THIS INITIATIVE
If you or someone you know has already begun this process, please contact us.

CRDS Will Lead the Effort to Include Behavior Analysis Occupations on O*NET.
Our understanding as of the date of writing is that we will need to lead this effort ourselves in order for it to happen.

We will pursue this effort to the best of our abilities because behavior analysis professionals are part of the CRDS community. We serve researcher-practitioners in the social and behavioral sciences, including the developing professions of Behavior Technician and Behavior Analyst.
