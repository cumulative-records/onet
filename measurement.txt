Our understanding is that ONET submissions are generally applied. Our interpretation of the site and its submission process leads us to infer that submissions are not the result of scientific inquiry in most cases.

We would like to provide an ONET submission that makes some use of scientific inquiry. For example, CRDS could seek to collect data from persons in the occupation to increase the validity of its ONET submission.

CRDS could also utilize data collection from public sources, such as the BACB website or job postings.

Existing methods in personnel psychology:
a. Ask for basic agreement of importance of item, then comparing how items perform.
b. Cut scores method of asking raters what percentage of minimally competent persons should be able to perform a task or competency, then averaging these together across items. We would discard or modify poorly performing items. An overall cut score would not necessarily be used.
c. Ask respondents to state the degree to which a critical incident fits with a certain performance area. This is more time consuming because we have to give counter examples in hopes that respondents will say these are unrelated (or else multiple loadings).
